Undone

Concept
"So... you accedenlty distroyed the world.  You were stealing power orbs from Evil Corp  . What you didnt realize is those orbs also kept the earths core stable and... Kaboom"
"The good news you have a time crystal and one shot to reverse what you've done"
"As time moves backwards so do you. You must undo everything you did at exactly the moment you did it or risk creating a temporal anomaly."
"Good luck"

Basis Mechanics
Character  runs in reverse.
Cannot go foward...
Jumping negats the natural physics (momentary pause)
(The longer the jump the faster you will move after like you got a running start.)

Start the level with items you need to put back. Dotted lines where they were.
Everything must be  returned or you fail.-Temporal anomaly %chance+counter each missed.
Failure to replace orb 100% fail if orb reaches end of screen
25% fail contact enemy

Items
Phase shifter (contact badies ok can pass through bottom of platforms)
Jetpack (can fly)
Anti gravity boots (can double jump)


5 floors  5-1all items return 1 item per floor fiest floor extra bassies.

Graphics ideas
